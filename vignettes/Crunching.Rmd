## Challenges with Household Survey analysis

Household survey often results in dataset with over 300 variables to process & explore. In Humanitarian Environment, deadlines to get insights from those dataset are often tight. Manual processing is very lengthy and can be done only for a limited part of the dataset. Often, because of those challenges, a lot of potential insights are not discovered. This package is developped to support this challenge around data crunching. It's part of the initiative around an [Integrated Framework for Household Survey (IFHS): A toolkit to facilitate design, collection & analysis](https://unhcr.github.io/Integrated-framework-household-survey/).

## Data Crunching

KoboloadeR packages aims at separating “_input_”, “_processing_” and “_output_” within the data crunching phase of the data analysis worklfow.

The “output” will be one or multiple Rmd (Rmarkdown) file(s) than will generate word, pdf or html reports and the configuration file includes references to all “input”:  
 
 * Path to __raw data__ files collected using [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/), [Kobotoolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) or [ONA](https://ona.io)  
 * Path to form (defined using the standard format [xlsform](http://xlsform.org)) in order to build a __data dictionary__  
 * Path to the __sample weight__ for each observation (based on cluster or strata...)   
 * Path to the data __cleaning log__  
 * Path to the __indicator calculation__ sheet  

## Advantage of KoboLoadeR 

 * __Productivity__: Once the configuration file is written, run the script in Rstudio to get the output
 * __Training__: No need to write R instruction – limited knowledge of R is required
 * __Iteration__: Check the output, adjust the various input files & re-run the script till you get a satisfying report
 * __Reproducibility__: all analysis input are de facto documented  

KoboLoadeR takes care of the processing component so that the technical team can focus on the interpretation.



## Features

The `koboloadeR` package allows to:

* connect to the [KoBo API (v1)](https://kc.kobotoolbox.org/api/v1/) for the [KoBo Toolbox](http://www.kobotoolbox.org/) project. 

* compute a data dictionnary based on [xlsform](http://xlsform.org). It implies ot have a few additionnal column in the xlsform in order to better define how data shoudl be analysid (cf infra). as it based on a standard, this part and the following should work for any [xlsform compatible server](http://xlsform.org/#xlsform-tools) such as [OpenDataKit](https://opendatakit.org/) or [ONA](https://ona.io/home/)

* generate automatically of a series of charts & maps based on the data dictionnary

* generate automatically of a series of charts & maps based on a formatted data analysis plan

* access to a series of dedicated Shiny application to set up your project

* support the full range of data science level

## Output from the package  

 * Frequency tables & Bar chart for select type questions
 * Frequency tables & Histogram for numeric questions
 * Frequency table for text questions
 * Cross-tab & graph (if 2 categorical: bar chart, if 1 categoric + 1 numeric: boxplot & if 2 numeric: scatterplot)
 * Chi-squared test & corrplot presentation
 * Mapping if geographic field are configured (still in development)
 * and more to come...
