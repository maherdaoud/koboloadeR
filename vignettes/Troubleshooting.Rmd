Before anything else, try to restart the R session:
* In R studio, on top go to "Session"
* "Restart R"

## Can not install the package

Note that in case you get the following error:

```
InternetOpenUrl failed: 'An error occurred in the secure channel support'
``` 

Enter the command:

```
setInternet2(TRUE)
```

Alternatively, you may add to .Rprofile or Rprofile.site the following line:

```
options(download.file.method = "wininet")
```

## Unable to move temporary installation

One common errors during the package installation is linked to the antivirus _"real time file system protection"_. The following will fix the problem:

```
trace(utils:::unpackPkgZip, edit=TRUE)

```
Edit line 140:

```
Sys.sleep(0.5)

```
to:

```
Sys.sleep(2)

```

## Error in strptime(xx, f, tz = tz) :  unable to identify current timezone 'C':    please set environment variable 'TZ'

```

## enter this commaned to set up the time zone - you may change it to another anotherone.
Sys.setenv(TZ='GMT')

## Now you can check...
Sys.timezone()
Sys.getenv("TZ")

```

### The application crashed
If the application (graphic interface) crashes, make sure that all packages necessary are loaded with:

```
source("code/0-packages.R")
``` 

Also make sure that you downloaded your data in the right format:
* Export as XLS
* XML values and headers
* Include groups in headers
* 'Group separator' as dot ('.')


### Error when building the dictionnary or configuration file

If you see this message (or similar error):
```
Error in file(file, ifelse(append, "a", "w")) : 
  cannot open the connection
```
It is most likely because you have the form, dictionary or data set open on your computer. If you close it and start over, the problem should be fixed.

  
### Error when loading packages
 If you get this error: 
 
```
Error: package or namespace load failed for 'rJava'
```

It could be because you have a 64bit version of R, but have a 32bit version of Java. Check this thread for guidance: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37735108/r-error-onload-failed-in-loadnamespace-for-rjava
