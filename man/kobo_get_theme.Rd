GENERAL THEME
we'll use this for most of our charts and build on it when we need to

THEME FOR 'WIDE' BAR CHARTS
there are several bar charts that are very wide, and need some special formatting

THEME FOR 'WIDE' BAR CHARTS
we'll use this for small multiple charts.  these also have some special formatting requirements

THEME FOR MAPS
It's based on theme_minimal and basically resets all the axes.
It also defined a very subtle grid and a warmgrey background, which gives it some sort of paper map feeling..
